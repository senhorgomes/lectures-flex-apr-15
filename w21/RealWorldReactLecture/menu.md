Real World React!

Only React
- Adding more packages, react node modules

React is only a Single Page App

- React Router
- useContext

Implement routing in a single page app

Create the following paths


/ - Homepage -> Welcome to our retro game shop!
/products - display all products
/products/[:id] - display a single product
/login - component to display for the user, which will make a post request to the backend



How do we create a navbar?


Routes
- / -> App.js
    - Error handling
- /users/id -> User profile page
    - We know the server takes in a email and password
    - We'll need a form to execute this post request
    - Rerouted? individual page


- /products/id -> Products that belong to user

- Products from a single user
- Provide a way for users to login
