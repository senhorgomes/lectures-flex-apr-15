How are projects managed?

Traditional(Waterfall) vs Agile workflow

Waterfall - A specific deadline (Finals)

- Each piece is worked on one at a time to launch the project all at once V1 - V2
- Prone to roadblocks
- More solid intial planning
- Can be harder to split tasks


-  Planning -> Database -> Backend -> Frontend -> Release

Client 
- Create a website for the government of Ontario
- Cost - $110k
- Timeline - 1 year & 2 month

- Planning - 1 month
- Database - 2 months -> 3 months
- Backend - 3 months
- Frontend - 5 months
- Debugging - 1 month -> 0

Pros?

Cons?
- Strict timeline with small margin of error
- Clients dislike -> They don't see progress

Agile - Existing products/apps

- It is very Scrum compatible
- Individuals/interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Pros?
